  <h1>Home information site</h1>
  <p>
  I am an engineering physics and mathematics postgraduate student.
  </p>
  <p>
  My interests are in applied mathematics: in particular intersections with artificial intelligence and finance. I like being able to bring applied mathematics to engineering projects related to current global issues.
